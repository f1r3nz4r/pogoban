# Pogoban

  Welcome to Pogoban, Sokoban but more pogger.
  This project started out as a meme among my 
  comp sci mates. But now its becoming a 
  reality.

  The game will start out as a humble command
  line program, but will soon grow into a
  fully fledged game.

  Feel free to download the code and run it on 
  your computers.

  Installation details and other miscellanous 
  information will release as soon as 
  version 0, "The backend update" is released.

  And as always, stay poggers ya pogchamps.
